I started these comics a few months ago when I was in a weirdly energetic mood. I was struggling with a longer project (see the [Bora the Brain tag](https://slit.margot.maison/tags/borathebrain/) on this blog...) and thought instead of spinning my wheels I'd just start a number of smaller projects for fun. I started these two comics and then tried planning out an Elden Ring fan comic. I felt very productive and "on" at the time but neither of these progressed past 2-3 pages.

The first is this mermaid comic. I also wanted to see what it was like just making a comic with a totally digital workflow. Found the drawing a bit hard... my hand got more cramped (not sure if tablet and monitor resolution are mismatched or something) and my eyes really hurt but it also seemed a lot faster and more convenient.

I liked these drawings more when I first made them but now they look at little stiff & fussy.

This comic was made in the usual way I work. It's meant to be more developed version of [this one page comic from last November](https://margot.maison/oneshots/wizprob/).

I have a link on my site to this blog and specifically the Bora the Brain tag -- I'd kind of like to make a page that just has some in progress work.
