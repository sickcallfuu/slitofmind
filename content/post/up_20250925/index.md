Just added this one page comic to the site: [Ball Isa](https://margot.maison/oneshots/ballisa/)
This was made for the September issue of [Art Review magazine](https://artreview.com/).

Also changed the image on the index page for this blog... the old one was this sketch of a fairy (a commorant fairy?)
