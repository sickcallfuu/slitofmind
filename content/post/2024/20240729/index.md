{{<img src= "/2024/cover_front.jpg" alt="star of swan cover">}}

There's been an excerpt from this comic on the site for a long time but it's finally being published August 18th. It's 60 pages and you can pre-order it from [Breakdown Press's website](https://www.breakdownpress.com/store/star-of-swan-by-margot-ferrick).

Breakdown is also publishing a short [collection of the Fromsoft fanart I've done over the past few years](https://www.breakdownpress.com/store/half-gold-half-dung-by-margot-ferrick).

# site updates
{{<img src= "/2024/pibbletree2.png" alt="pibble tree 2">}}

* Added a couple of drawings to:
    * [Wizards II](https://margot.maison/wizards/2024/)
    * [Bora Visions](https://margot.maison/boravisions)
* Fixed [Bora the Brain](https://margot.maison/bora) layout so it's not as ugly. Replaced all page images (the first 2 chapters were saved with a bright, white paper color but now they're slightly off-white.)
* Fixed layout of [Fuu's Archive](https://margot.maison/fuu/) a bit.
* Added a new section called [dump](https://margot.maison/dump/), which is just for drawings and sketches that I don't like as much or are incomplete or abandoned.
* Changed site layout. Also made some slight changes to this blog's layout.
* Added link to this site I use to keep track of stuff I'm reading / watching [https://sickcallfuu.github.io/](https://sickcallfuu.github.io/)
