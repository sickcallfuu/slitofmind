🫧 Hi, I've decided to use this blog to record updates to the main site. I'll try to post stuff that's in progress too when I can. I've been trying to post stuff online in this order: Patreon --> margot.maison site --> various social media... I try to wait about a week between posting something on Patreon before posting it somewhere public. I haven't updated margot.maison in a few months but I'll try to do it more regularly. I've sort of given up on using social media with any kind of consistency.

# work added to main site:
- 2 new digital drawings under [Wizards 2023](https://margot.maison/wizards/). This'll be the last update to that section, I'll start a new one for this year. All these characters are related to an original character (working on a related story.)

- 3 weird little quick drawings of stingrays added under [Drawings 2022-2023](https://margot.maison/draw2022-2023/).

- New drawing section titled [Bora Visions](https://margot.maison/boravisions/) which is for stand alone drawings related to the [Bora the Brain comic](https://margot.maison/bora/about.html).
- New comics section [Fuu's Archive](https://margot.maison/fuu/) for old comics / drawings featuring a character named Fuu.
