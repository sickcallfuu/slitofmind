# Printed Work
{{<img src="/2024/cover.jpg" alt="cover of Lagon 7, PLUIE." caption="This is the cover.">}}

I have a short comic in the new Lagon book, PLUIE. It's available over [here!](https://revuelagon.com/) Here's a page from it. It's based on Elden Ring...

# Site Updates
## Comics
{{<img src="/2024/poddycalf_bleed_011.png" alt="poddy-calf page 11">}}

Added a new section called [SCRAP](https://margot.maison/scrap/), which is for comics that are either in progress or finished comics that I can't post online in full. Some of these are short pieces made for anthologies. I think technically it would be fine posting the whole thing online but it seems like better etiquette (?) to wait until after the anthology has been out for a bit.  


## Drawings
{{<img src="/2024/mantawiz.png" alt="manta ray wizard on the shore." caption="manta ray wizard on the shore.">}}

Updated [Wizards II](https://margot.maison/wizards/2024/) page with 7 new drawings made from late February to now.

## Illustration

## ??
Added a link to this site: [https://petselbee.uk/](https://petselbee.uk/)

## minor changes
- Layout changed slightly, just tried to simplify everything (basically just a list...) Some stuff might be mismatched but I'll try to get the site looking cohesive.
- Replaced a couple of digital drawings under [Wizards I](https://margot.maison/wizards/2023/) (sort of minor reworking / changed colors a bit.)

## to do
- Add new section for short comics from 2023-2024
- Section for sketchbook stuff
- Update Dark Souls / Elden Ring site
  
## goodnight...
Sleep schedule is somewhat better.
