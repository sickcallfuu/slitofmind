Drawn on some old Calcomp paper found at a local thriftstore. I'm assuming it was made to work with plotters like [this](https://computermuseum.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/dev/ibm1130/album/rt_calcomp.html) but the rolls I found have pretty wide perforated margins on the sides so I'm not sure if they're for something else. 

This paper is really thin and translucent (taped to a piece of thicker drawing paper here so it looks maybe more yellowish) but takes ink nicely. The width is a little wider than the JIS B4 manga paper I've been using too so it's kind of convenient.
