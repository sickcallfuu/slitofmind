I started learning how to use Blender back in 2020 and really enjoyed it but then stopped using it for few years... recently got the urge to relearn. This is a sculpt started a couple of months ago.

I think I never really made it past an intermediate-beginner level back when I was first learning... a lot of things here are probably really inefficient / sloppy tbh.
