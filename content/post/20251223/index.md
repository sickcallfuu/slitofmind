Made an rss feed for the updates section on the main site so you can follow that over here if you want: [https://margot.maison/up_log/index.xml](https://margot.maison/up_log/index.xml)
I thought this made more sense than using this blog for site updates. It would be nice to use this blog more often just for sketches and stuff.

Also, added a new gallery to the main site, which is full of sort of scrappy images that might not be finished yet... I don't really know where to put these right now: [A Swollen Dug](https://margot.maison/art/a_swollen_dug)
