Selling a bunch of art and original comics pages again, over here:
[margotmaison.bigcartel.com](https://margotmaison.bigcartel.com)

There's some stuff from a while ago, including spreads from this 2019 [Dognurse](https://margot.maison/comics/dognurse/) sequel that I abandoned:

In the past, I've just closed the shop after the initial sales slow down (things usually taper off after the first week or so) but I'm going to try to keep it open a bit longer / more consistently this time. I have some more work to comb through so I'll be adding more in maybe a couple of weeks. I've also been thinking for a while about making and selling some quicker, fun drawings for a bit cheaper.

(Maybe it would be fun to get a b&w printer and make some small runs of zines too...)
