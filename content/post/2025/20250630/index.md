I must have drawn this a couple of months ago. (Adjusted levels to make it more contrasty -- it doesn't look like this irl.) Updated the [progress table](/page/bora_table) for this comic. I was scanning things at 600dpi and need to rescan them all at 1200.

Also...
fixed some minor things on the main site (section "Bora the Brain [OLD]" wasn't set up right..!)
