My friend [Leomi Sadler](https://leomisadler.com/) is having a show at [Micro Service](https://micro-service.xyz/) in Seoul -- go see it if you're in town! The 3rd floor is all work by Leomi while the 4th floor features work by a bunch of friends (including some printouts of drawings by me...) There's also a screenprinting workshop on Sunday, June 8th.
