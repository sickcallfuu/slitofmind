BORA THE BRAIN / ch01_003.
This is a redo of [this comic](https://margot.maison/bora_old/ch01/), which was drawn back in late 2021 - early2022.

Also made this table to log my progress... Think for future posts I'll just paste the row for whatever chapter I'm working on and I'll keep the whole thing on [this page over here](/page/bora_table).
